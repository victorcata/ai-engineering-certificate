# Clustering, Dimension Reduction, and Feature Engineering

## How They Work Together

- **Clustering, dimension reduction, and feature engineering** are complementary techniques.
- They **enhance model performance, quality, and interpretability**.
- Workflows often combine them to:
  - Improve computational efficiency and scalability.
  - Simplify data structures.
  - Reduce redundancy in features.

## Dimension Reduction

- **Goal:** reduce the number of features while preserving essential information.
- **Benefits:**
  - Simplifies **visualization** of high-dimensional clusters.
  - Improves **clustering outcomes** by reducing sparsity in high dimensions.
  - Reduces computational load and noise.
- **Common techniques:**
  - **PCA (Principal Component Analysis)** → projects data onto orthogonal axes (linear).
  - **t-SNE (t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding)** → preserves local similarities (nonlinear).
  - **UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection)** → balances local/global structure.

### Example: Face Recognition

- Dataset: **966 faces**.
- PCA applied → extracted **150 eigenfaces** as features.
- Projected onto eigenface basis, then **SVM** trained.
- Reduced dimensionality preserves identity features while lowering cost.

## Clustering

- **Groups data points or features** into clusters based on similarity.
- Applied both to:
  - **Observations** (e.g., customer segmentation).
  - **Features** (to detect redundancy).

### Use Cases

- **Exploratory data analysis** (finding natural groupings).
- **Feature selection**: choosing one representative feature per cluster.
- **Feature engineering**: creating interactions or transformations based on subgroup patterns.

## Feature Engineering with Clustering

- Cluster features based on statistical similarity.
- Example: **5 synthetic features** with means (1, 5, 10) and variances (1 or 2).
  - Features 1–3 → similar (redundant).
  - Features 4–5 → distinct.
- Using **K-Means with k=3** grouped them correctly.
- From Cluster 1, only one feature needs to be kept → reduces dimensionality & redundancy.

## Key Takeaways

- **Dimension Reduction:** preprocessing step to simplify structure, reduce noise, and improve clustering.
- **Clustering:** can segment observations or features; supports feature selection.
- **Feature Engineering:** uses clustering insights to select/transform features.
- Combined, these techniques **boost interpretability, reduce complexity, and improve predictive power**.
