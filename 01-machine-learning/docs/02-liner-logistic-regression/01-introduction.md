# Introduction to Regression

## What is Regression?

- A **supervised learning model** that predicts a **continuous target variable** using explanatory features.
- Example: Predicting **CO2 emissions** of cars from features such as engine size, cylinders, and fuel consumption.

## Types of Regression

1. **Simple Regression**

   - One independent variable → predicts one dependent variable.
   - Can be **linear** (straight-line relationship) or **nonlinear**.
   - Example: Predict CO2 emissions from engine size.

2. **Multiple Regression**
   - More than one independent variable.
   - Can also be linear or nonlinear.
   - Example: Predict CO2 emissions using engine size + number of cylinders.

## Applications of Regression

- **Business & Sales**

  - Forecast sales performance.
  - Predict yearly sales from leads, customers, order history.

- **Real Estate**

  - Predict house prices based on size, bedrooms, location.

- **Engineering & Maintenance**

  - Predict when machines/vehicles will need maintenance.

- **Finance & Employment**

  - Estimate income based on education, experience, hours worked, etc.

- **Environmental Science**

  - Estimate rainfall from meteorological data.
  - Predict severity of wildfires.

- **Healthcare & Public Health**
  - Predict disease spread (e.g., infectious diseases).
  - Estimate likelihood of developing conditions (diabetes, heart disease, cancer).

## Algorithms

- **Classical**: Linear regression, polynomial regression.
- **Modern ML**: Random Forest, XGBoost, KNN, Support Vector Machines, Neural Networks.

## Key Takeaways

- Regression = models relationships to predict **continuous values**.
- **Simple regression** → one variable; **Multiple regression** → multiple variables.
- Applications span **business, environment, healthcare, finance, and beyond**.
- Choice of regression algorithm depends on the data and context.
