# Data Scientist vs AI Engineer (Generative AI)

## Industry Shift

- **Data Science**: Traditionally the “sexiest job of the 21st century.”
- **AI Engineering**: Emerged with **Generative AI breakthroughs** (foundation models).
- Generative AI = new field that expands beyond traditional ML.

---

## 1. Use Cases

- **Data Scientist = Storyteller**

  - Focus: descriptive & predictive analytics.
  - Techniques:
    - **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)**
    - **Clustering** (customer segmentation)
    - **Regression** (predict numbers, e.g., revenue)
    - **Classification** (predict categories, e.g., success/failure)

- **AI Engineer = System Builder**
  - Focus: prescriptive & generative use cases.
  - Techniques:
    - **Decision Optimization** (choose best action).
    - **Recommendation Engines** (targeted campaigns).
    - **Generative Apps**: chatbots, intelligent assistants, coding copilots.

## 2. Data

- **Data Scientist**:

  - Mainly **structured/tabular data** (hundreds–hundreds of thousands of rows).
  - Heavy cleaning, preprocessing, feature engineering.
  - Outlier removal, joins, filters, transformations.

- **AI Engineer**:
  - Mainly **unstructured data** (text, images, video, audio).
  - E.g., **LLMs** trained on **billions–trillions of tokens**.
  - Much larger scale.

---

## 3. Models

- **Data Scientist**:

  - Wide toolbox (many algorithms/models).
  - Each use case = new dataset + new model.
  - Narrow scope, smaller models (seconds–hours to train).

- **AI Engineer**:
  - Toolbox centered on **Foundation Models**.
  - One model generalizes across many tasks.
  - Huge scale (billions of parameters, thousands of GPUs, weeks–months of training).
  - Broad scope.

## 4. Processes

- **Data Scientist Process**:

  1. Define use case.
  2. Collect & prepare data.
  3. Train & validate model (feature engineering, cross-validation, hyperparameter tuning).
  4. Deploy model for prediction/inference.

- **AI Engineer Process**:
  1. Define use case.
  2. Start with **pre-trained foundation model**.
  3. Apply **prompt engineering** + frameworks:
     - **Chaining prompts**.
     - **PEFT (parameter-efficient fine-tuning)**.
     - **RAG (retrieval-augmented generation)**.
     - **Autonomous agents**.
  4. Embed into larger systems/apps (assistants, UIs, automations).
  - **AI democratization**: open-source models (e.g., Hugging Face) make this accessible.

## Key Takeaways

- **Data Scientist** = insights & predictions from structured data using diverse ML models.
- **AI Engineer** = builders of generative AI systems using foundation models & unstructured data.
- Overlap exists, but **Generative AI** drives new distinctions in **use cases, data, models, and processes**.
- Both fields are rapidly evolving with constant research and tools.

**In short:**

- Data Scientist → Data storyteller.
- AI Engineer → AI system builder.
