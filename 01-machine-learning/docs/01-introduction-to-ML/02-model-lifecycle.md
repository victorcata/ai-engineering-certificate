# Machine Learning Model Lifecycle

## Key Processes

1. **Problem Definition**

   - Clearly define the problem or situation the ML model should address.

2. **Data Collection**

   - Gather data from various sources.
   - Part of the **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)** process.

3. **Data Preparation**

   - Clean, transform, and store data in a centralized place for accessibility.
   - Ensures data is ready for model training.

4. **Model Development & Evaluation**

   - Build ML models using prepared data.
   - Test and evaluate models to measure performance.

5. **Model Deployment**
   - Deploy model into production for real-world use.

## Important Notes

- The lifecycle is **iterative**:  
  If issues arise in production, you may need to revisit earlier steps (e.g., data collection, even problem definition).
- ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) is central to preparing data for machine learning engineers.

## Takeaway

A Machine Learning Model Lifecycle includes:  
**Problem Definition → Data Collection → Data Preparation → Model Development & Evaluation → Model Deployment**,  
with iteration and feedback loops at every stage.
