# A Day in the Life of a Machine Learning Engineer

## Goal of the Project

- Build and deploy a **recommendation model** for beauty products.
- Problem statement (client’s pain point):  
  _“As a customer, I want product recommendations based on my purchase history to address skincare needs and improve skin health.”_

---

## Lifecycle Steps in Practice

### 1. Problem Definition

- Align ML solution with client needs.
- Ensure business goals (increasing revenue) match end-user requirements.

### 2. Data Collection

- Sources:
  - User data (demographics, purchase history, transactions).
  - Product data (ingredients, popularity, ratings).
  - Behavioral data (saved/liked products, search & browsing history).
- Data is **centralized** through wrangling, joining, and mapping (ETL).

### 3. Data Preparation

- Clean and format data:
  - Remove irrelevant/extreme values.
  - Handle missing values.
  - Ensure correct data formats (e.g., dates, strings).
- **Feature engineering:**
  - Avg. time between transactions.
  - Most purchased products.
  - Skin issues targeted by products.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
  - Plot patterns, validate with experts.
  - Correlation analysis for feature importance.
- **Train/Test split:**
  - Example: recent transactions in test set, older in training.

### 4. Model Development

- **Content-based filtering:**
  - Recommends products similar to those purchased.
  - Uses product features/ingredients to generate similarity scores.
- **Collaborative filtering:**
  - Groups users by characteristics (age, region, skin type).
  - Recommends based on ratings/purchase behavior of similar users.
- **Hybrid model:** Combines content-based + collaborative filtering.

### 5. Model Evaluation

- Initial evaluation: tune model, test with held-out test set.
- User evaluation: experiment with recommendations, collect feedback.
- Metrics: user ratings, clicks, conversions (purchases).

### 6. Model Deployment

- Integrated into app/website.
- Continuous **monitoring** to track performance and alignment with business needs.
- Iterative: retraining with new data to improve and expand capabilities.

## Key Insights

- **Problem definition** is critical for business alignment.
- **Data collection & preparation** are the most time-consuming steps.
- **Deployment isn’t the end** — ongoing monitoring and retraining are necessary.
- Success depends on **iteration, feedback, and refinement** throughout the lifecycle.
