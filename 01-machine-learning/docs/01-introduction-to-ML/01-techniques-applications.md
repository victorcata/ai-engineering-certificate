# Machine Learning Techniques & Applications

## AI and ML Basics

- **Artificial Intelligence (AI):** Broad field simulating human cognition (includes CV, NLP, generative AI, ML, DL).
- **Machine Learning (ML):** Subset of AI using algorithms and feature engineering to learn patterns from data.
- **Deep Learning (DL):** Uses multi-layered neural networks to automatically extract features from complex, unstructured data.

## Types of Learning

- **Supervised Learning:** Trains on labeled data to predict unknown labels (e.g., classification, regression).
- **Unsupervised Learning:** Works with unlabeled data, finds patterns (e.g., clustering).
- **Semi-Supervised Learning:** Mix of small labeled data + large unlabeled data, iteratively self-labeling.
- **Reinforcement Learning:** Agent learns by interacting with environment and receiving feedback.

## ML Techniques

- **Classification:** Predict categories (benign vs malignant cell, customer churn).
- **Regression:** Predict continuous values (house prices, CO2 emissions).
- **Clustering:** Group similar cases (customer segmentation, patient similarity).
- **Association:** Discover items/events that co-occur (market basket analysis).
- **Anomaly Detection:** Find abnormal cases (credit card fraud).
- **Sequence Mining:** Predict next events (clickstream analytics).
- **Dimension Reduction:** Reduce number of features while keeping relevant info.
- **Recommendation Systems:** Suggest items based on user similarities (Netflix, Amazon).

## Applications

- **Healthcare:** Predict benign vs malignant cells for early cancer detection.
- **Finance:** Loan approval, fraud detection, default probability.
- **Telecom:** Customer churn prediction.
- **Computer Vision:** Classify cats vs dogs using learned features.
- **Everyday Life:**
  - Virtual assistants & chatbots
  - Face recognition
  - Content/product recommendations
  - Gaming (chess, AI opponents)

## Key Takeaway

Machine Learning empowers computers to learn from data, adapt without explicit programming, and is applied across healthcare, finance, retail, telecom, and entertainment. Humans remain in the loop for oversight and decision-making.
