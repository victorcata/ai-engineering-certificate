# AI Engineer Professional Certificate (Coursera)

This repository contains my notes, code exercises, and projects from the [AI Engineer Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ai-engineer) by IBM.

## üß† Overview

The certificate is designed to equip engineers with practical skills to build, fine-tune, and deploy AI systems. It covers:

- AI Foundations and Use Cases
- Machine Learning Models and Evaluation
- Deep Learning and Neural Networks
- Generative AI (including LLMs)
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Tools and Infrastructure for AI Engineering

## üìÅ Repository Structure

Each folder corresponds to a main topic or course in the certificate:

- `01-foundations/`: Basics of AI, use cases, ethics, and problem framing.
- `02-ml-models/`: Traditional machine learning algorithms, model evaluation, and pipelines.
- `03-deep-learning/`: Neural networks, CNNs, and training techniques.
- `04-generative-ai/`: Text generation, prompt engineering, and diffusion models.
- `05-llms/`: Working with Large Language Models and fine-tuning.
- `06-mle-tools/`: Tools and techniques for production AI (e.g. LangChain, vector DBs, RAG).
- `shared/`: Utility code and shared components across courses.

Each topic folder includes:

- `notes.md`: My personal notes and summaries.
- `exercises/`: Solutions to hands-on exercises.
- `mini-projects/`: End-of-section projects or creative applications.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup

You can use a virtual environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
